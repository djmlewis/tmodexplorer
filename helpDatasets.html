    <h2><a name="Vaccines_and_Trial_letter_codes"></a>Vaccines and Trial
      letter codes</h2>
    <p>The trials have been given letter codes:<br>
      A: Single dose of Stamaril, Varilrix or saline, in Surrey<br>
      B: Engerix B or saline given as priming, booster #1 and booster #2
      in Surrey. Only priming (Engerix B1) and second booster (Engerix
      B3) included in dataset.<br>
      C: Single dose of Fluad, Agrippal or saline in Surrey.<br>
      D: Single dose of Fluad or saline in Gent.<br>
      D2: Single dose of Boostrix or saline in Gent.<br>
      H: VSVHIVGAG or saline or no immunisation, in various sites in USA
      run by HVTN.<br>
      Q: alpha-RIX-Tetra quadravalent seasonal influenza vaccine given
      as a single dose in Gent.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Placebo_groups"></a>Placebo groups</h2>
    <p>There are various placebo groups included in the various datasets
      and are described below. In general terms I would advise caution
      with the PLACEBO B3 / PLACEBO3 set as it has only 4 members, and I
      would suggest ignoring it. The PLACEBO AB1C is a pooled group from
      all the sub-protocols run at Surrey, which some statisticians may
      criticise. However, to have a placebo group of only 4 or 6 that
      happened to be randomised alongside the 20 or so in each of the
      vaccine groups in the same sub-protocol seems inferior to me than
      to use the pooled group of 20/21 which was the intention all
      along. The Surrey trials were highly controlled and I think it is
      reasonable to take the AB1C as a single group.</p>
    <p>More problematic is the FLUAD D GENT PLACEBO group, which has
      only 6 members, leading to some significantly wide error bars. I
      would tentatively suggest that the BOOSTRIX D2 PLACEBO group with
      20 members gives a better picture of the biology, even if the
      subjects were not randomised with the D trial and are separated
      from it in time by around a year.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The alpha-RIX-Tetra protocol included 20 subjects all given the
      influenza vaccine with no placebo group, as it was a control for a
      human infection challenge. Only days 0-1-2-3 were sampled. </p>
    <p>The HVTN trial was problematic. Transcriptomics were run on whole
      blood collected at various time points after a single immunisation
      with VSV-HIV gag, following various DNA primings. However, only 17
      of the 19 participants who received VSVGAG were per protocol due
      to some deviations in the primings for two. I have pooled all 19
      who received VSVHIVGAG irrespective of deviations in the primings.
      A placebo group N = 3 received saline injection, but there appear
      to be some day 1 responses which is unusual. Finally 2 subjects
      who were allocated to receive VSVHIVGAG actually had no injection
      but simply venesection. So I have grouped the 5 participants who
      had either saline or no immunisation into a group "VSVHIVGAG
      SHAM".<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Surrey_trials_-_days_5_-_7_transition"></a>Surrey
      trials - days 5 - 7 "transition"<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The Placebo AB1C group is important as between the day 5 and day
      7 samples the Surrey participants left the inpatient unit and
      became outpatients. Whereas samples in the datasets are always
      0800 on days -1 to 5, on days 7 - 28 they may be any time in the
      working day. Also, in several variables a marked transition occurs
      at day 7 - see the neutrophils for example - implying a reset of
      their physiology once the inpatient restrictions are lifted.
      Similarly the Day -1 0800 sample is often abnormal as participants
      were newly admitted on that morning. For these reasons I suggest
      that Surrey data be limited to days 0-5. An exception may be
      Stamaril where it looks like the incubation period places the peak
      effects between days 5 - 7.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Subgroups"></a>Subgroups at different time points<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The BOOSTRIX D2 GENT protocol was very complex with half the
      cohort split to attend on day 2 <b>or</b> day 3 but not both.
      There are also splits between day 21 and 28. So the mean values
      that are presented will flip between the whole cohort and mutually
      exclusive members on days 2 and 3.</p>
    <h2><a name="Transcriptomics_Data_"></a>Transcriptomics Data and
      normalisation<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The&nbsp; transcriptomics datasets have been uploaded to the
      server, but must be selected and loaded into the app before use.
      They come in two versions: <b>fold-increase in the log2
        expression values</b> (by subtraction of the log2 expression
      values), <i>always from day 0</i> <i>baseline</i> (in Surrey day
      -1 is treated as a time point preceding day 0); and <b>raw log2
        expression values</b>. Day 0 at 8AM was selected for Surrey as
      baseline as participants entered the unit on day -1. The data were
      calculated by initially grouping the raw data for each person -
      each probe - each time point, into treatment and time point pools.
      Then row averages for each probe within the treatment ~ time pool
      were calculated. This gives the basic raw expression data which is
      the group mean for each vaccination-day for each probe, i.e. the
      mean expression for Probe X on day Y for participants who received
      vaccine Z.<br>
    </p>
    I have normalised the ABCDD2 arrays all together using limma to
    background corrected and quantile normalise as one group for the <i><b>ABCDD2</b></i>
    <i><b>probe expression</b> </i>dataset<i>. </i>I background
    corrected and quantile&nbsp; normalised the VSVHIVgag arrays
    together for the <b><i>H </i></b><i><b>probe expression</b> </i>dataset,
    and similarly the alpha-RIX-Tetra for the Q dataset. These data sets
    are presented separately. <br>
    <br>
    For the <i><b>fold-change dataset</b></i> I normalised all the
    arrays <b>for each participant separately</b>, as I calculate a
    fold-change from baseline for each participant separately and so
    each participant is self-standardised to their day 0. Then I
    combined the normalised mean data for ABCDD2, H and Q into one
    dataset by column-binding. While this may be a nonstandard way to
    normalise it is convenient in this demonstration software to have
    all the vaccines available for plotting in one dataset.<br>
    <h2><a name="Cytokines_Data_"></a>Cytokines Data<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The&nbsp; cytokines dataset has been uploaded to the server and
      loads automatically on start up. It is a single combined dataset
      with data from Surrey ABC trials, and Gent Fluad (D). No cytokine
      data are available for the Gent Boostrix trial (D2). The data have
      been handled in a similar way to the transcriptomics ABC Surrey
      Agilent (see above) with the addition of D. There is a single
      placebo group for Surrey AB1C, pooled from all participants, plus
      a separate PlaceboB3 group of those who had the third Engerix B
      immunisation. Fluad Gent is separate with its own placebo group
      (with only 6 participants), and also has only a subset of
      available days compared with Surrey.</p>
    <p> Two versions of data are available: <b>actual concentrations</b>,
      and <b>fold-increase from day 0</b>, which can be selected using
      radio buttons on the Plot panel. For fold increase, if the day 0
      value was zero or absent for a particular participant, then no
      fold increase can be calculated and the participant's data for
      that cytokine is absent from all calculations at all time points.
      The plot gives the option to show the group size per day
      (available data at import including NA and 0) and the N with
      usable data, so you can see the actual group size contributing to
      each day's mean/median value. As the data contain a lot of zero
      (below threshold of detection) values, the option to remove zero
      values from calculation of means and median/IQR also exists, so
      that the kinetics of only measurable responses can be plotted. For
      TREM1 there were some "OOR" values (out of range) which have just
      been replaced by NA on import, and hence deleted from
      calculations. No log transformations have been done, this is an
      option when plotting.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Cells_Data"></a> Cells Data</h2>
    The&nbsp; white cells dataset has been uploaded to the server but
    does not load automatically on start up - you need to click the
    button. It is a single combined dataset with data from Surrey ABC
    trials, Gent Fluad (D) and Gent Boostrix (D2). The data have been
    handled in a similar way to the transcriptomics ABC Surrey Agilent
    (see above) with the addition of D and D2. There is a single placebo
    group for Surrey AB1C, pooled from all participants undergoing their
    [first] immunisation, plus a separate Placebo 3 group of those who
    had the third Engerix B immunisation. The Engerix subjects are
    similarly divided into B1 and B3. Fluad Gent is separate with its
    own placebo group (with only 6 participants), and also has only a
    subset of available days. The same applies to Boostrix Gent (D2)
    which has a separate and larger placebo group, n = 20. The raw cell
    counts data are available, together with pre-processed means and
    medians with SD and SEM. A <b>Fold Change</b> from day 0 baseline
    is also calculated for each cell type. Beware mixing Surrey and Gent
    raw data as normal ranges will vary between sites. Fold Change
    should harmonise things between sites.<br>
