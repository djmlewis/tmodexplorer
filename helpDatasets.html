    <h1><a name="The_Datasets"></a>The Datasets</h1>
    <h2><a name="Placebo_groups"></a>Placebo groups</h2>
    <p>There are various placebo groups included in the various datasets
      and are described below. In general terms I would advise caution
      with the PLACEBO B3 / PLACEBO3 set as it has only 4 members, and I
      would suggest ignoring it. The PLACEBO AB1C is a pooled group from
      all the sub-protocols run at Surrey, and some statisticians would
      demur as it is pooled from sub-groups included the 3 protocols in
      Surrey. However, to have a placebo group of only 4 or 6 that
      happened to be randomised alongside the 20 or so in each of the
      vaccine groups in the same sub-protocol seems inferior to me than
      to use the pooled group of 20/21 which was the intention all
      along. The Surrey trials were highly controlled and I think it is
      reasonable to take the AB1C as a single group.</p>
    <p>More problematic is the FLUAD D GENT PLACEBO group, which has
      only 6 members, leading to some significantly wide error bars. I
      would tentatively suggest that the BOOSTRIX D2 PLACEBO group with
      20 members gives a better picture of the biology, even if the
      subjects were not randomised with the D trial and are separated
      from it in time by around a year, but most statisticians would
      demur...<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Surrey_trials_-_days_5_-_7_transition"></a>Surrey
      trials - days 5 - 7 "transition"<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The Placebo AB1C group is important as between the day 5 and day
      7 samples the Surrey participants left the inpatient unit and
      became outpatients. Whereas samples in the datasets are always
      0800 on days -1 to 5, on days 7 - 28 they may be any time in the
      working day. Also, in several variables a marked transition occurs
      at day 7 - see the neutrophils for example - implying a reset of
      their physiology once the inpatient restrictions are lifted.
      Similarly the Day -1 0800 sample is often abnormal as participants
      were newly admitted on that morning. For these reasons I suggest
      that Surrey data be limited to days 0-5. An exception may be
      Stamaril where it looks like the incubation period places the peak
      effects between days 5 - 7.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Subgroups"></a>Subgroups at different time points<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The BOOSTRIX D2 GENT protocol was very complex with half the
      cohort split to attend on day 2 <b>or</b> day 3 but not both.
      There are also splits between day 21 and 28. So the mean values
      that are presented will flip between the whole cohort and mutually
      exclusive members on days 2 and 3.</p>
    <h2><a name="Transcriptomics_Data_"></a>Transcriptomics Data<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The&nbsp; transcriptomics datasets have been uploaded to the
      server, but must be selected and loaded into the app before use.
      They come in two versions: <b>fold-increase in the log2
        expression values</b> (by subtraction of the log2 expression
      values), <i>always from day 0</i> <i>baseline</i> (in Surrey day
      -1 is treated as a time point preceding day 0); and <b>raw log2
        expression values</b>. Day 0 at 8AM was selected for Surrey as
      baseline as participants entered the unit on day -1. The data were
      calculated by initially grouping the raw data for each person -
      each probe - each time point, into treatment and time point pools.
      Then row averages for each probe within the treatment ~ time pool
      were calculated. This gives the basic raw expression data which is
      the group mean for each vaccination-day for each probe, i.e. the
      mean expression for Probe X on day Y for participants who received
      vaccine Z.<br>
    </p>
    <p>One group of datasets, based on <i><b>limma-normalised</b></i>
      expression values, consists of the <b> protocol-defined grouping
        of the vaccines and associated placebo group</b>:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>D Gent Fluad-Placebo (<i>NB only 6 in placebo group</i>)<br>
      </li>
      <li>D2 Gent Boostrix-Placebo (<i>NB days 2 and 3 contain mutually
          exclusive halves of the cohort</i><i>, placebo = 20</i>)</li>
    </ul>
    The D and D2 data are derived from exported files, and are
    problematic in that the rows do not have proper <b>Probe IDs</b>. I
    have included a ProbeName identifier to link the Probe identifier
    (row ID) to the chip Probe Identifier but there appear to be
    duplications and other issues. <b>These two datasets must therefore
      be treated with caution</b>. The lack of a proper consistent Probe
    ID also prevents comparison with the Surrey data or between D and
    D2.<br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>I have also included a <b>combined Surrey dataset</b> in which
      the vaccines in A, B and C are all together, based on <i><b>agilent</b></i><i><b>-normalised</b></i>
      expression values. This dataset therefore has the pattern:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ABB3C Surrey Agilent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This dataset appears to be slightly better than the D and D2, but
      has been normalised differently. This is a large dataset and so
      can be slow, but allows very convenient comparison between
      vaccines. The sub-protocols in which the participants were
      randomised between the treatment groups are: "A" = Stamaril,
      Varilrix and Placebo;&nbsp; B = Engerix B (prime &amp; boost) or
      placebo (twice);
      "C" = Fluad, Agrippal &amp; Placebo.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In this dataset the PLACEBO group contains all ~21 participants
      pooled from AB1C.&nbsp;&nbsp; For <b>Engerix B</b> the
      participants were naive and received a priming vaccination
      alongside a placebo group: this is indicated as ENGERIXB and
      PLACEBO in the same way as A &amp; C. The same participants then
      had a second immunisation (first boost) without any systems
      biology. They then came for a third immunisation (second boost) on
      day 167. This is represented in the dataset as EngerixB3 and
      PLACEBO3. The time points for ENGERIXB3/PLACEBO3 have been
      adjusted so that Day 167 becomes -1, and 168 day 0. <i>Fold-increase
        is then calculated from this adjusted day 0</i>, as the response
      to the third immunisation. Thus the ENGERIXB and PLACEBO have been
      pooled with the AC Surrey trials, but the ENGERIXB3 and&nbsp; the
      PLACEBO3 (<i>which</i><i> has only 4 participants)</i> are
      presented as a separate group, and PLACEBO3 should probably be
      ignored. <br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Cytokines_Data_"></a>Cytokines Data<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The&nbsp; cytokines dataset has been uploaded to the server and
      loads automatically on start up. It is a single combined dataset
      with data from Surrey ABC trials, and Gent Fluad (D). No cytokine
      data are available for the Gent Boostrix trial (D2). The data have
      been handled in a similar way to the transcriptomics ABC Surrey
      Agilent (see above) with the addition of D. There is a single
      placebo group for Surrey AB1C, pooled from all participants, plus
      a separate PlaceboB3 group of those who had the third Engerix B
      immunisation. Fluad Gent is separate with its own placebo group
      (with only 6 participants), and also has only a subset of
      available days compared with Surrey.</p>
    <p> Two versions of data are available: <b>actual concentrations</b>,
      and <b>fold-increase from day 0</b>, which can be selected using
      radio buttons on the Plot panel. For fold increase, if the day 0
      value was zero or absent for a particular participant, then no
      fold increase can be calculated and the participant's data for
      that cytokine is absent from all calculations at all time points.
      The plot gives the option to show the group size per day
      (available data at import including NA and 0) and the N with
      usable data, so you can see the actual group size contributing to
      each day's mean/median value. As the data contain a lot of zero
      (below threshold of detection) values, the option to remove zero
      values from calculation of means and median/IQR also exists, so
      that the kinetics of only measurable responses can be plotted. For
      TREM1 there were some "OOR" values (out of range) which have just
      been replaced by NA on import, and hence deleted from
      calculations. No log transformations have been done, this is an
      option when plotting.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Cells_Data"></a> Cells Data</h2>
    The&nbsp; white cells dataset has been uploaded to the server but
    does not load automatically on start up - you need to click the
    button. It is a single combined dataset with data from Surrey ABC
    trials, Gent Fluad (D) and Gent Boostrix (D2). The data have been
    handled in a similar way to the transcriptomics ABC Surrey Agilent
    (see above) with the addition of D and D2. There is a single placebo
    group for Surrey AB1C, pooled from all participants undergoing their
    [first] immunisation, plus a separate Placebo 3 group of those who
    had the third Engerix B immunisation. The Engerix subjects are
    similarly divided into B1 and B3. Fluad Gent is separate with its
    own placebo group (with only 6 participants), and also has only a
    subset of available days. The same applies to Boostrix Gent (D2)
    which has a separate and larger placebo group, n = 20. The raw cell
    counts data are available, together with pre-processed means and
    medians with SD and SEM. A <b>Fold Change</b> from day 0 baseline
    is also calculated for each cell type. Beware mixing Surrey and Gent
    raw data as normal ranges will vary between sites. Fold Change
    should harmonise things between sites.<br>
