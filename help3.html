    <b>This is beta software and may experience bugs and crashes.</b>
    Please (politely) report any bugs to d.j.lewis@surrey.ac.uk.<br>
    <br>
    The software depends on the R package <b><font size="+1">tmod</font>
      '</b><b><cite>Feature Set Enrichment Analysis for Metabolomics and
        Transcriptomics</cite></b><b>'</b> (<a
href="http://bioinfo.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/tmod/tmod_paper_peerjpreprints_2016.pdf"
      target="_blank">description</a>), created by January Weiner. I
    have reverse engineered some aspects of tmod and any errors arising
    from this are mine. Consult the <a
      href="https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.2420v1/supp-2"
      target="_blank">tmod documentation</a> or <a
      href="https://d3amtssd1tejdt.cloudfront.net/2016/2420/1/tmod.pdf"
      target="_blank">vignette</a> for a description of the modules.<br>
    <br>
    The transcriptomics and cytokines datasets are from the BIOVACSAFE
    project (<a href="http://www.biovacsafe.eu" target="_blank">www.biovacsafe.eu</a>),














































    and were generated by the group of Stefan Kaufmann at MPIIB, Berlin
    and provided by Jeroen Maertzdorf and January Weiner. I have
    generated&nbsp; averages per treatment ~ time point and
    fold-increases, and any errors there are mine. The cells data were
    generated by the Data Management team at Surrey and are GCP
    compliant, although the various means and fold-changes have been
    calculated by me.<br>
    <br>
    The trials were conducted at the University of Gent by Geert
    Leroux-Roels, and at the University of Surrey by me.<br>
