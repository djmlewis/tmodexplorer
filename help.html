    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
    The purpose of this app is to be a <font size="+1"><b>data
        visualisation tool</b></font> - nothing more. <i>No statistical
      analysis is done</i> and you must be aware of the risk of <b>false
      discovery</b>. However, it leverages the unique design of
    BIOVACSAFE in that the same chip was used in the same clinical
    sites, and so if the same genes or modules keep popping-up across
    different vaccines (or the reverse) this has some significance.
    Similarly the fact that we have a complete time course allows for
    some discrimination based on the response curve and adjacent points.
    While False Discovery statistics can be applied to two-point
    comparisons (using packages like tmod or limma) where every gene is
    considered possibly important in the setting of every other gene,
    this tool allows a more nuanced approach to gene responses to the
    vaccines tested based on the kinetics and comparison between
    vaccines as well as placebos.<br>
    <br>
    The purpose is just to visualise <b>the expression of genes</b>
    <b> as a time course after immunisation</b>, either alone or when
    clustered into Blood Transcriptional Modules (BTMs). This mimics the
    usual way immunologists observe cell or antibody kinetics. In
    addition it allows to <b>look inside the BTMs</b> to observe how
    the individual genes are responding to the vaccine stimulus. <br>
    <br>
    The datasets are composed of <b>rows</b> of data where each row is
    a <font size="+1" color="#cc0000"><b>spot</b></font> on the chip,
    and the <b>columns</b> contain the group mean value (raw expression
    or fold-change from baseline) for that spot. The groups are a
    specific <b>treatment~time point</b> combination: e.g. Boostrix~Day
    1, Fluad~Day 7, etc. I use the term "spot" and "row" interchangeably
    as they are the same. One "Probe" ( specific nucleic acid sequence)
    may map to many spots, and one gene may map to many probes. Row /
    ProbeNames are unique, GeneNames may be duplicated
    across rows.<br>
    <br>
    The simplest approach is to pick a particular vaccine~day
    combination&nbsp; - <i>e.g. Day 7 after immunisation with Boostrix</i>
    - and then sort rows by the values in that column. This imposes the
    same <b>row (spot) order</b> on other time points and vaccines. Why
    do this? Well, because with over 40k spots you have to order them
    somehow. The grouping by <i><b>treatment</b></i> (vaccine or
    placebo) ~ <i><b>time</b></i> combination is actually a natural
    grouping, if a bit counter-intuitive when comparing between
    vaccines. You can also order rows by value <i>at any time point for
      one selected vaccine, </i>rather than specifying a specific day.
    The question becomes: <i>How do the top N genes in the day 1
      response to Fluad behave on day 1 after Boostrix?</i> Or maybe: <i>How
      do the top N genes on day 1 after Fluad behave over time?</i><br>
    <br>
    Having ordered the top or bottom spots, or found spots with values
    between a range, you can then group the spots or genes into a set of
    interest - e.g. the top 10 fold-increased genes on day 7 after
    Boostrix. <i><b>This set of selected spots-&gt;probes-&gt;genes
        becomes the core building-block of subsequent analysis</b></i>.
    You can plot how the expression changes over time (in all the
    treatment groups); which modules the genes belong to; observe how
    the other genes in those modules are responding over time; or how
    the whole module responds over time. You can treat these rows as a
    'pseudo-module' and see how this module changes over time in
    comparison with the predefined modules in tmod. Other search options
    allow you to select spots/probes/genes by their title or description
    instead of (or as well as) their expression values, and then follow
    these selected genes and the modules that contain them over time.<br>
    <br>
    The figures below illustrates this: the spots have been sorted in <i>descending

      order of their fold-increase from baseline (day 0) in log2
      expression value in the participants 7 days after receiving
      Stamaril</i>. The top 10 spots with the highest fold-increase have
    been selected and the time series plotted as individual lines for
    Stamaril, Fluad and Placebo, or as a boxplot for these spots treated
    as though they belonged to a pseudo-module.<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="selgenesseries.png" alt="Selected
        Probes" width="554" height="250"> &nbsp;<img
        src="selgenesseriesbox.png" alt="Selected Probes Boxplot"
        width="554" height="250"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    We can then identify the modules to which those genes belong, and
    plot the changes in those modules over time. Note that while the
    kinetics of the spots is clear-cut, the modules are less so, with
    some non-responding modules. This reflects that fact that modules
    contain many other genes that may not be responding to Stamaril at
    all, or even down-regulated, as&nbsp; the genes in the modules have
    been clustered by their authors on the basis of various criteria:<br>
    <div align="center"><img src="selmods.png" alt="Selected Modules"
        align="middle" width="550" height="249">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img
        src="selmodsseries.png" alt="Selected Modules Timecourse"
        align="middle" width="550" height="249"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    When plotting the time-course of genes as an average of the spots,
    it may become apparent by wide SEM ribbons that spots mapping the
    same gene are behaving discordantly. It is possible to split the
    gene averages back into the component spots to identify which genes
    have aberrant spots using the <a href="#Gene%E2%AB%B7Probes"><b>Geneâ«·Spots</b></a>
    option. For example, as shown in the figure below for some top genes
    upregulated on day 7 after Stamaril, while the two IFIT2 spots (red)
    respond similarly, one of the OAS2 spots (green) is a log2 lower
    than the other two, and the two RSAD2 spots are far apart (blue).
    These discrepancies are also seen in the wide SEM ribbons.<br>
    <div align="center"><img src="probessplit.png" alt="Genes Split Into
        Probes" width="640" height="250"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    Choosing the correct day to sort the spots by is important as the
    kinetics of responding genes varies significantly. For example
    sorting on day 1 after Fluad brings up genes with a very sharp
    kinetics associated with cytokines etc. Sorting on day 7 brings up
    genes mapping to immunoglobulins with a broader kinetics. Notably
    whereas Day 1 genes map reasonably well to modules, none of the top
    10 day 7 genes map to any tmod modules. Sorting on day 5 brings up a
    new set of genes together with some of the day 7 genes.<br>

        width="311" height="250"><img src="day7genesmodules.png" alt=""
        width="348" height="250"><br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    There is also an option to go straight to exploring by modules, in
    which case you just select tmod modules and observe their response
    over time. Modules can be selected in the same way as individual
    spots or genes - by identifying those most up- or down-regulated
    modules (based on median or mean value of all spots mapping to the
    module) for a selected treatment ~ time; or by searching for modules
    by text keyword. The basic concept is the same, as shown here where
    the <i>top 10 modules up-regulated on day 7 after Stamaril</i> are
    identified, and the response over time plotted. Modules can be
    further selected by <i>Title</i> and <i>Category</i>. The plots
    below actually show the 8 <i>Titles</i> that these top 10 modules
    belong to. Note that the kinetics is more clear-cut because we have
    forced the selection to filter on the mean or median expression
    value or fold-increase of modules. However, as we have selected by
    module this may not be very representative of the actual top
    responding genes (as shown above), because the important genes may
    be clustered with non-responding genes in other modules. <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="topmods.png" alt="Top Modules"
        width="553" height="250">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img
        src="topmodsseries.png" alt="Top Modules Timecourse" width="553"
        height="250"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    By visualising the changes in gene and module expression we can ask
    how do the tmod modules respond after immunisation and how does this
    compare when we select individual genes? Are there other gene
    groupings that may be better? Do some BTMs have so many
    non-responding genes that they are not representative? Could we
    cluster new modules?<br>
    <h3><a name="Plots"></a>Plots</h3>
    <p><font size="+1" color="#cc0000"><b><em>Plots may take some time
            to appear - be patient!</em></b></font> The more rows you
      select for plotting the slower it will be. ggplot2 is not good at
      providing progress updates - so it may look like nothing is
      happening. Some plots are drawn automatically and these offer the
      choice of using R base graphics (faster) or ggplot2 (slower but
      may be prettier). Other plots have a <b>Plot</b> button, and will
      only draw or update when that is clicked, to avoid slow refreshes
      when you alter several options. Plots have a slider control&nbsp;<img
        alt="" src="slider.png" width="82" height="20"> to change the
      height. Plot width always resizes automatically with the window
      width. A low resolution image of plots can be copied or saved by
      right-clicking on the plot, while clicking <b>â¤ Plot As PNG</b>
      button downloads a high resolution image. The plotting parameters
      are not sophisticated, but generally the data used to create the
      plot are in a table below and can be saved and imported into R or
      other packages for plotting. Some tables can be saved as PNG files
      to incorporate with plots as graphics.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Identifying data on line plots by clicking or selecting points<br>
    </h4>
    When data are plotted as <b>Lines</b> it is sometimes difficult to
    identify the individual data series by colour. They can be
    identified by clicking a <b>point</b> (or where a point would be
    plotted if you are not displaying points). Clicking line segments
    between points does nothing. Click and drag a rectangle to include
    multiple points. A table will appear displaying the data, which can
    be copied. A comma-separated list of gene/spot and module names is
    also shown to easily copy and paste into search boxes.<br>
    <p> </p>
    <h3><a name="Data_Tables_"></a>Data Tables<br>
    </h3>
    Where a data table is shown, the entire table can be searched using
    the box above,&nbsp; or individual columns searched using the boxes
    below each column. Tables can be downloaded as a csv file suitable
    for opening in Excel or R by clicking the <b>â¤ Table</b> button. A
    PNG image of the data table can also be downloaded in some cases by
    clicking the button <b>â¤ Table as PNG</b>. This can be pasted onto
    graphics. It is very tricky to calculate the width correctly using
    grid.table, so the image may be clipped or extra wide, but a
    transparent background will be generated.<br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="Saving_Gene_Probe_ProbeNames_and_"></a>Saving Gene,
      ProbeNames and Module Lists<br>
    </h3>
    The datasets have been normalised together so that ProbeNames, row
    IDs and Gene names are the same across vaccines. This allows
    identification of responses for a specific spot/probe/gene between
    vaccines.<br>
