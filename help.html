    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
    The purpose of this app is to be a <font size="+1"><b>data
        visualisation tool</b></font> - nothing more. <i>No statistical
      analysis is done</i> and you must be aware of the risk of <b>false

      discovery</b>. However, it leverages the unique design of
    BIOVACSAFE in that the same chip was used in the same clinical
    sites, and so if the same genes or modules keep popping-up across
    different vaccines (or the reverse) this may have some <i><b>biological
        significance</b></i>. Similarly the fact that we have a complete
    time course allows for some selection of gene sets based on the
    response curve and adjacent points. While False Discovery statistics
    can be applied to two-point comparisons (using packages like tmod or
    limma) where every gene is considered possibly important in the
    setting of every other gene, this tool allows a more nuanced
    approach to gene responses to the vaccines tested based on the
    kinetics and comparison of response/non-response between vaccines as
    well as placebos. This mimics the usual way immunologists observe
    cell or antibody kinetics and draw inferences from those, as well as
    by doing statistical testing.<br>
    <br>
    An additional purpose is to visualise <b>the expression of genes</b><b>
      when clustered into Blood Transcriptional Modules</b> (BTMs). In
    addition it allows to <b>look inside the BTMs</b> to observe how
    the individual genes are responding to the vaccine stimulus. <br>
    <br>
    In this version of the tool, datasets are composed of <b>rows</b>
    of data where each row is a <b>mean value of spots mapping to a
      single unique probe (a defined RNA sequence)</b> on the chip, and
    the <b>columns</b> contain the <b>group mean value</b> (raw
    expression or fold-change from baseline) for that probe. In the data
    preparation, initially all spots mapping to a unique probe were
    averaged for each participant at each time point. Then those means
    were averaged for each probe by combining participants into one
    group. The groups are a specific <b>treatment~time point</b>
    combination: e.g. Boostrix~Day 1, Fluad~Day 7, etc. I use the term
    "probe" and "row" interchangeably as they are the same. One "Probe"
    ( specific nucleic acid sequence) may map to many spots, and one
    gene may map to many probes. Row / ProbeNames are unique, GeneNames
    may be duplicated across rows. (Previous versions had one spot per
    row, but to incorporate 306B data which maps only a subset of the
    BIOVACSAFE chip probes, the average of probe values had to be used).<br>
    <br>
    The simplest approach is to pick a particular vaccine~day
    combination&nbsp; - <i>e.g. Day 7 after immunisation with Boostrix</i>
    - and then sort rows by the values in that column. This imposes the
    same <b>row (probe) order</b> on other time points and vaccines.
    Why do this? Well, because with over 40k probes you have to order
    them somehow. The grouping by <i><b>treatment</b></i> (vaccine or
    placebo) ~ <i><b>time</b></i> combination is actually a natural
    grouping, if a bit counter-intuitive when comparing between
    vaccines. You can also order rows by value <i>at any time point for
      one selected vaccine, </i>rather than specifying a specific day.
    The question becomes: <i>How do the top N genes in the day 1
      response to Fluad behave on day 1 after Boostrix?</i> Or maybe: <i>How

      do the top N genes on day 1 after Fluad behave over time?</i><br>
    <br>
    Having ordered the top or bottom probes, or found probes with values
    between a range, you can then group the probes or genes into a set
    of interest - e.g. the top 10 fold-increased genes on day 7 after
    Boostrix. <i><b>This set of selected probes-&gt;genes becomes the
        core building-block of subsequent analysis</b></i>. You can plot
    how the expression changes over time (in all the treatment groups);
    which modules the genes belong to; observe how the other genes in
    those modules are responding over time; or how the whole module
    responds over time. You can treat these rows as a 'pseudo-module'
    and see how this module changes over time in comparison with the
    predefined modules in tmod. Other search options allow you to select
    probes/genes by their title or description instead of (or as well
    as) their expression values, and then follow these selected genes
    and the modules that contain them over time.<br>
    <br>
    The figures below illustrates this: the probes have been sorted in <i>descending


      order of their fold-increase from baseline (day 0) in log2
      expression value in the participants 7 days after receiving
      Stamaril</i>. The top 10 probes with the highest fold-increase
    have been selected and the time series plotted as individual lines
    for Stamaril, Fluad and Placebo, or as a boxplot for these probes
    treated as though they belonged to a pseudo-module.<br>
    <br>

        Probes" width="554" height="250"> &nbsp;<img
        src="selgenesseriesbox.png" alt="Selected Probes Boxplot"
        width="554" height="250"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    We can then identify the modules to which those genes belong, and
    plot the changes in those modules over time. Note that while the
    kinetics of the probes is clear-cut, the modules are less so, with
    some non-responding modules. This reflects that fact that modules
    contain many other genes that may not be responding to Stamaril at
    all, or even down-regulated, as&nbsp; the genes in the modules have
    been clustered by their authors on the basis of various criteria:<br>
    <div align="center"><img src="selmods.png" alt="Selected Modules"
        width="550" align="middle" height="249">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img
        src="selmodsseries.png" alt="Selected Modules Timecourse"
        width="550" align="middle" height="249"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    When plotting the time-course of genes as an average of the probes,
    it may become apparent by wide SEM ribbons that probes mapping the
    same gene are behaving discordantly. It is possible to split the
    gene averages back into the component probes to identify which genes
    have aberrant probes using the <a href="#Gene%E2%AB%B7Probes"><b>Gene⫷Probes</b></a>
    option. For example, as shown in the figure below for some top genes
    upregulated on day 7 after Stamaril, while the two IFIT2 probes
    (red) respond similarly, one of the OAS2 probes (green) is a log2
    lower than the other two, and the two RSAD2 probes are far apart
    (blue). These discrepancies are also seen in the wide SEM ribbons.<br>
    <div align="center"><img src="probessplit.png" alt="Genes Split Into
        Probes" width="640" height="250"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    Choosing the correct day to sort the probes by is important as the
    kinetics of responding genes varies significantly. For example
    sorting on day 1 after Fluad brings up genes with a very sharp
    kinetics associated with cytokines etc. Sorting on day 7 brings up
    genes mapping to immunoglobulins with a broader kinetics. Notably
    whereas Day 1 genes map reasonably well to modules, none of the top
    10 day 7 genes map to any tmod modules. Sorting on day 5 brings up a
    new set of genes together with some of the day 7 genes.<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    There is also an option to go straight to exploring by modules, in
    which case you just select tmod modules and observe their response
    over time. Modules can be selected in the same way as individual
    probes or genes - by identifying those most up- or down-regulated
    modules (based on median or mean value of all probes mapping to the
    module) for a selected treatment ~ time; or by searching for modules
    by text keyword. The basic concept is the same, as shown here where
    the <i>top 10 modules up-regulated on day 7 after Stamaril</i> are
    identified, and the response over time plotted. Modules can be
    further selected by <i>Title</i> and <i>Category</i>. The plots
    below actually show the 8 <i>Titles</i> that these top 10 modules
    belong to. Note that the kinetics is more clear-cut because we have
    forced the selection to filter on the mean or median expression
    value or fold-increase of modules. However, as we have selected by
    module this may not be very representative of the actual top
    responding genes (as shown above), because the important genes may
    be clustered with non-responding genes in other modules. <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="topmods.png" alt="Top Modules"
        width="553" height="250">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img
        src="topmodsseries.png" alt="Top Modules Timecourse" width="553"
        height="250"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    By visualising the changes in gene and module expression we can ask
    how do the tmod modules respond after immunisation and how does this
    compare when we select individual genes? Are there other gene
    groupings that may be better? Do some BTMs have so many
    non-responding genes that they are not representative? Could we
    cluster new modules?<br>
    <h3><a name="Plots"></a>Plots</h3>
    <p><font size="+1" color="#cc0000"><b><em>Plots may take some time
            to appear - be patient!</em></b></font> The more rows you
      select for plotting the slower it will be. ggplot2 is not good at
      providing progress updates - so it may look like nothing is
      happening. Some plots are drawn automatically and these offer the
      choice of using R base graphics (faster) or ggplot2 (slower but
      may be prettier). Other plots have a <b>Plot</b> button, and will
      only draw or update when that is clicked, to avoid slow refreshes
      when you alter several options. Plots may have a slider
      control&nbsp;<img alt="" src="slider.png" width="82" height="20">
      to change the height. Plot width always resizes automatically with
      the window width. A low resolution image of plots can be copied or
      saved by right-clicking on the plot, while clicking <b>⤓ Plot As
        PNG</b> button downloads a 300 dpi high resolution image if the
      <b>HiRes </b>checkbox is selected or else a 72 dpi low res image.
      The plotting parameters are not sophisticated and only modestly
      customisable, but generally the data used to create the plot are
      in a table below and can be saved and imported into R or other
      packages for plotting. Some tables can be saved as PNG files to
      incorporate with plots as graphics.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Identifying data on line plots by clicking or selecting points<br>
    </h4>
    When data are plotted as <b>Lines</b> it is sometimes difficult to
    identify the individual data series by colour. They can be
    identified by clicking a <b>point</b> (or where a point would be
    plotted if you are not displaying points). Clicking line segments
    between points does nothing. Click and drag a rectangle to include
    multiple points. A table will appear displaying the data, which can
    be copied. A comma-separated list of gene/probe and module names is
    also shown to easily copy and paste into search boxes.<br>
    <p> </p>
    <h3><a name="Data_Tables_"></a>Data Tables<br>
    </h3>
    Where a data table is shown, the entire table can be searched using
    the box above it,&nbsp; or individual columns searched using the
    boxes below each column. Tables can be downloaded as a csv file
    suitable for opening in Excel or R by clicking the <b>⤓ Table</b>
    button. A PNG image of the data table can also be downloaded in some
    cases by clicking the button <b>⤓ Table as PNG</b>. This can be
    pasted onto graphics. It is very tricky to calculate the width
    correctly using grid.table, so the image may be clipped or extra
    wide, but a transparent background will be generated.<br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="Saving_Gene_Probe_ProbeNames_and_"></a>Saving
      Annotations Lists<br>
    </h3>
    The datasets have been normalised together so that ProbeNames are
    the same across vaccines. This allows identification of responses
    for a specific probe/gene between vaccines. Clicking the red Text
    File button where available allows a text file with comma-separated
    and newline-separated lists of the selected annotation symbols. In
    tmodExplorer it is best to use the <b>Gene</b> annotations to paste
    into filter boxes as these are a portmanteau of the various other
    annotations, and will always be available for every probe. Outside
    tmodExplorer probably the GeneSymbol, Entrez or ENSEMBL identifiers
    should be used, but may not be available for every probe on the
    chip. The <b>Gene</b> annotation has been assembled by sequentially
    selecting&nbsp; the GeneSymbol defined on the chipset (HGNC, may be
    out of date) if available, then the GeneSymbol mapped to a probe ID
    using the David webtool, then the ENSEMBLE ID, finally the ProbeName
    if there is no annotation available. Some probes match lincRNA
    sequences, and if no GeneSymbol is available, the Description is
    used instead where a lincRNA term is detected. All this is a
    compromise, but it means that the <b>Gene</b> identifier should
    have some meaningful label attached where possible.<br>
